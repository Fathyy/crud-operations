# Crud operations

This is a project showing basic functionality such as Create, update and deletion of users stored in a database. The data is displayed in a table form and alongside it are edit and delete buttons. The user can delete and edit the records displayed on the table.
The user's profile includes a wide range of data such as text, drop down menu, checkboxes and radio buttons. Each field listed here is validated before being stored in the database. The data is escaped before being outputted on the screen as well.
For styling, I have relied on Bootstrap 5 to style elements such as input forms and the table. There is also an alert to show if a user has been updated or created.
The delete and edit buttons are styled using Fontawesome 6 as well as the create icon. The project has utilized PDO to make a connection to the database. The database queries are prepared and executed accordingly before they are fetched and displayed.
