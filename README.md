# Crud operations

This is a project showing basic functionality such as Create, update and delete of users stored in a database. The data is displayed in a table form and alongside it are edit and delete buttons. The user can delete and edit the records displayed on the table.
For styling, I have relied on Bootstrap 5 to style elements such as input forms and the table. There is also an alert to show if a user has been updated or created.
The delete and edit buttons are styled using Fontawesome 6 as well as the create icon. The project has utilized PDO to make a connection to the database. The database queries are prepared and executed accordingly before they are fetched and displayed.
